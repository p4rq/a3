## Structure

This project contains the following main directories and files:

- `controllers`: This directory contains the controllers for the project. Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending the response back to the client.

- `locales/en`: This directory contains the English locale files. These files are used for internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to support multiple languages.

- `models`: This directory contains the models for the project. Models represent the data in your application and define how to interact with your database.

- `node_modules`: This directory contains the Node.js modules used in the project. These modules provide additional functionality for your application.

- `public/styles`: This directory contains the style files for the project. These files define the look and feel of your application.

- `routes`: This directory contains the routes for the project. Routes define the endpoints of your application and how they should respond to client requests.

- `views`: This directory contains the views for the project. Views define how your application's data is presented to the user.

- `.env`: This file contains environment variables. These variables are used to configure your application's settings.

- `.gitattributes`: This file contains Git attributes. These attributes can be used to customize how Git handles certain files in your repository.

- `app.js`: This is the main application file. It sets up your application and brings everything together.

- `i18n.js`: This file contains internationalization configurations. These configurations allow your application to support multiple languages.

- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- `package.json`: This file contains metadata relevant to the project. It includes things like the project's name, version, description, and dependencies.
